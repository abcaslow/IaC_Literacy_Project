Error Handling in Python


Use try/except blocks:
    
    
Specifying except: alone catches all exceptions:
    
 try:
    f = open('hello-there.csv')
except:
    print("Wrong file name!")

Now let's specify the specific Python Error Name. Remeber to put the colon at the end of the Python error name:
    
try:
    f = open('hello-there.csv')
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Wrong file name!")

try:
    bdf = Table.read_table('hello-there.csv')
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Check the spelling of the file name with an ls command and check the file path with pwd")
history

try:
    x
except: NameError
    print ('check your spelling')


try:
    xx
except NameError as ex:
    print (ex)

try:
      xx
except NameError as ex:
      print ('The following variable:', ex)
      
      

research using the "raise" and "pass" statements with Python try/except blocks.
=================

try:
   # do something
   pass
except ValueError:
   # handle ValueError exception
   pass
except (TypeError, ZeroDivisionError):
   # handle multiple exceptions
   # TypeError and ZeroDivisionError
   pass
except:
   # handle all other exceptions
   pass
