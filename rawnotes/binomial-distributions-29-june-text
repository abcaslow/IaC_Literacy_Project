Binomial Distributions

Pascal's Triangle/Pascal's Right Triangle
(x + y)**2
(x + y)**3
(x + y)**4
(x + y)**n
when you expand out these binomial equations, you get a set of coefficients that form Pascak's Triangle.

Select a bunch of things from a pair of unknowns - call the pair of unknowns x and y.
The selection must be an unordered selection since it is unordered, it is commutative.

(x + y)**2
(x + y)**3
(x + y)**4
(x + y)**n

selection with replacement
